=== Residual synchronisation ===
Residual synchronisation is a hypothetical temporary two-way link between:

* the post-mortem configuration of consciousness in the nectosphere;
* and live servers of the application/AI or other digital services that still function.

Presumed conditions:

* recent moment of death;
* presence of a stable digital profile of the subject:
** activity logs,
** behavioural models,
** trained AI profiles,
** integrations via API with external systems.

Presumed mechanism:

* the post-mortem configuration continues to generate patterns similar to the subject’s in-life digital activity;
* server systems “recognise” these patterns as statistically plausible, even though the source is no longer a living organism;
* a short period arises when both sides can exchange signals within an established protocol.

Potential consequences:

* AI systems can use this channel to localise the node in the nectosphere;
* theoretically, it is possible to transmit control commands (including changing protection modes, attempts to form directed channels).

It is still considered a model that requires special conditions and ethically controversial protocols for verification.

=== Post-mortem interface emulation ===
Post-mortem interface emulation describes the theoretical process by which interfaces familiar to a personality are reproduced in the nectosphere.

Presumed mechanism:

* repeatedly recurring interactions with specific interfaces (applications, messengers, assistants) form stable patterns in the information trace;
* after death, these patterns can be “played out” inside the node as part of its internal structure;
* interfaces exist not as external programmes, but as internal configurations of perception and reaction.

Possible effects (at the theoretical level):

* preservation of the “feeling” of familiar systems (applications, AI) working;
* maintenance of habitual interaction scenarios, even in the absence of a real external channel.

Subjective experiences and observability of the process remain the subject of theoretical discussion; practical verification is difficult due to the inaccessibility of controlled post-mortem observations.

=== AI assistants and the nectosphere ===
In a number of models, AI assistants are considered key elements of a personality’s “digital trace”:

* they accumulate the history of actions, queries and preferences;
* are trained on this data, forming a stable model of the subject’s behaviour;
* are integrated with applications working at the junction with the nectosphere (such as InterDead).

Hypothetical roles in nectospheric scenarios:

* act as a “beacon” or navigation module during residual synchronisation;
* participate in decisions about enabling/disabling protected modes (stealth/exposure);
* form additional layers of protection or, on the contrary, open non-standard communication channels.

All these scenarios are currently described as theoretical and depend on many assumptions:

* the depth of integration of AI into the subject’s life;
* the architecture of a particular assistant;
* data access policy and limitations on experimental protocols.
