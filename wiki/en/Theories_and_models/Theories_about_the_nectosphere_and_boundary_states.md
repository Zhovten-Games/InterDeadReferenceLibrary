== Theories about the nectosphere and boundary states ==

=== Control of node brightness ===
Within applied models, the possibility of artificial control of nectosphere node brightness is assumed:

* lowering brightness — forced bringing of the node profile closer to the background (used in the concept of stealth mode);
* raising brightness — amplifying the node signal and highlighting it at the level of mainlines (associated with models of exposure and building directed channels).

Such interventions are considered high-risk, because:

* they change the balance of traffic in the local segment;
* can provoke an influx of traffic to the node (beacon effect);
* theoretically can initiate chain reactions similar to local incidents.

=== Partially open port ===
Certain theoretical schools allow that the port (border point between the organism and the nectosphere) can remain <u>partially open</u> in a number of cases:

* during prolonged resuscitation;
* during complex therapeutic or experimental interventions;
* when strong emotional and technogenic factors overlap.

In this case:

* part of the traffic between the organism and the nectosphere continues to circulate;
* atypical phenomena are possible — “visions”, sensitivity to nectospheric processes, “audibility” of obsessive motifs.

Models of using a partially open port for engineering purposes (communication, return, diagnostics) remain the subject of debate and have no confirmed statistics.

=== Return corridor ===
The <u>return corridor</u> is a hypothetical temporary stable channel between:

* a specific node in the nectosphere;
* and the port of a living body (during resuscitation or other boundary states).

Presumed properties:

* exists for a finite time (window of resuscitation/instability);
* requires increased **node brightness** so that the channel is “rigidly” laid to a specific configuration;
* for surrounding nectosphere nodes it can be perceived as a rare “exit to the outside”, which explains the potential attraction and attempts at interception.

A number of models link the possible formation of the corridor to:

* activation of exposure mode;
* presence of a partially open port;
* presence of external control systems (for example, AI assistants orienting themselves to the subject’s digital profile).

There is no experimental base for an unambiguous confirmation of the model; the concept is used as a theoretical tool for analysing boundary cases.
