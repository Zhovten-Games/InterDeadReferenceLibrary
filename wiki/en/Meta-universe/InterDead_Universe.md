InterDead is a psychologically oriented horror game in development by [[https://www.linkedin.com/company/zhovten-games/ Zhovten Games]], featuring a visual-novel interface and tabletop role-playing sessions (TTRPG), forming the core of the eponymous meta-universe.

== How the universe develops ==

The InterDead project develops as an authorial universe of Zhovten Games studio.

* tabletop role-playing sessions are regularly conducted within the InterDead world;
* materials and observations obtained during TTRPG sessions are used to refine and develop the canon;
* decisions regarding fixation and formulation of canonical elements are made by the project authors.

The InterDead world is described rather strictly from a technical perspective (nectosphere, mainlines, protocols, InterDead application). The canon is considered evolving in the sense that its foundational framework is already defined, while further work focuses on clarifying connections, consequences, and formulations arising from practical model usage.

At present, sections primarily open for free public editing are those related to:

* theoretical models;
* key incidents and generalized cases.

Other pages (core lore, techno-descriptions, critical entities) are edited by project authors and moderators.

== Speculative-scientific horror (Speculative Fiction / SpecFi)<ref name="specfi" /> ==

Speculative-scientific horror (Speculative Fiction Horror, SpecFi Horror) is a form of horror arising from speculative systems, hypotheses, and internally coherent models rather than spectacle or shock effects.

Its focus includes:

* imagined technologies, protocols, or institutions and their unintended consequences;
* rational or pseudo-rational attempts to formalize grief, fear, and the unknown;
* horror as a byproduct of logic, procedures, and repetition.

In InterDead, this is constructed atop:

* languages and sign systems (emoji, universal language attempts, nectospheric protocols);
* psychologically oriented fear models (PsiFramework, EFBD — Echoed Big Five of Dread);
* techno-lore of an experimental application for communicating with the dead.

<ref name="specfi">
The term Speculative Fiction (SpecFi) is used here in a broad, non-marketing sense — as an umbrella designation for narratives built around hypothetical systems, technologies, or social mechanisms.
It is chosen deliberately to emphasize that in InterDead, horror functions as a consequence of structured ideas, procedures, and speculative models rather than as an end in itself.

=== On textual style and authorial perspective ===

Any description of the InterDead world within this wiki is presented as authorial narrative, framed in an academic or pseudo-academic manner.

Characteristic features include:

* formalized language;
* light bureaucratic tone;
* an attempt to describe emotional and existential themes through schemes, terms, and procedures.

This style is chosen deliberately and constitutes part of the project’s artistic device.

As literary associations, it is appropriate to recall Lovecraft and Hodgson as examples of presenting material in the form of reports, notes, and pseudo-scientific documents.

=== Sources of inspiration ===

The InterDead project draws inspiration from various works of horror culture and speculative fiction, including:

* the aesthetics of “forbidden texts” and dangerous knowledge;
* corporeal and textual horror;
* the conception of networks as environments of alienation, loneliness, and loss;
* the film Pulse (Kairo) and related interpretations of the network as a space of isolation;
* the works of Clive Barker, in which the boundary between body, text, and the other world is blurred.

These sources serve as the cultural and artistic background of the project and are used as references for mood, imagery, and thematic emphasis.
