== InterDead Application ==

An experimental application for communication with nodes of the [[Nectosphere|nectosphere]].

<code>'''Terminology:''' in the professor’s documents and in some internal materials, the application is referred to as '''NOIR''' (Nectosphere-Oriented Interface Relay) — this is the working name of the messenger/system. In this wiki, the name “InterDead application” is used further.</code>

The application is considered an access and filtering interface rather than a means of addressing specific individuals.

=== Core declared objectives ===

* establishing one-time or serial contacts with arbitrary [[Nectosphere_node|nectospheric nodes]];
* obtaining memory fragments, responses, and interaction outcomes through formalized protocols;
* ensuring the safety of the living user via continuous signal masking.

=== Limitations ===

* the application is not intended to summon a “specific person”;
* contact is established according to the principle of statistical resonance;
* stealth mode is singular, permanent, and non-disableable.

== Emoji Protocol ==

The Emoji Protocol is a supralinguistic interaction protocol with the nectosphere, based on meaning formalization through a limited set of symbols.

* emoji sequences are transformed into a semantic vector;
* the vector is projected into the nectosphere;
* the node with the highest profile match is selected.

Reasons for choosing emoji:

* they are not bound to any national language;
* they are convenient for semantic modeling and context limitation;
* they reduce the risk of direct linguistic and emotional escalation.

A detailed description is provided in a separate article:

* [[Emoji_Protocol]]

== Semantic vector ==

A semantic vector is a mathematical representation of message meaning as a point or cloud in multidimensional space.

* each emoji combination corresponds to a coordinate set;
* node search follows the “nearest match” principle;
* results are probabilistic and fragmentary.

== Statistical resonance ==

The mechanism underlying contact:

* the application does not address a specific personality;
* a node most closely matching the semantic request profile is selected;
* contact emerges as a side effect of pattern coincidence.

This explains:

* the impossibility of guaranteed summoning of a desired individual;
* the variability and incompleteness of obtained responses.

== Stealth mode ==

Stealth mode is the only and mandatory operational mode of the application.

Technical features:

* emotional-semantic request profiles are fragmented and smoothed;
* the signal is masked as background activity;
* the source is not perceived by the nectosphere as a significant node.

Consequences:

* minimization of local direct contact risk;
* proxying of interactions through remote segments;
* reduced likelihood of sustained “reverse interest” from nodes.

No additional or “enhanced” stealth modes are not provided.

== Interaction protocol (simplified) ==

# the user formulates a request (most often as an emoji sequence).
# the request is converted into a semantic vector and projected into the nectosphere.
# the node with the highest profile match is selected.
# response activity arises on the node side.
# rhe response may be received:
## as emoji;
## as an image;
## as an audio fragment;
## as a linked artifact.

The response format is determined by accumulated context and emoji protocol rules.

== Artifacts ==

In some sessions, interaction results in an artifact — a linked object recorded in an acceptable form:

* image;
* audio fragment;
* link;
* other digital anchor.

Obtaining an artifact is considered a valid possible session outcome.

== Typical session lifecycle ==

# request initialization (emoji → semantic vector).
# resonant node search.
# emergence of response activity.
# (Optional, situational) if a request implies image capture but admissibility is unclear, an intermediate consent/acknowledgement step may be introduced to clarify whether image transmission is acceptable.
# receipt of response or artifact.
# session termination and cluster activity decay.

== Theoretical models and hypotheses ==

The following concepts are not mandatory protocol components but are used to interpret observed effects.

=== Residual synchronization ===

A hypothesis of temporary bidirectional linkage between consciousness configuration in the nectosphere and living digital services.

Considered a model within [[Techno-theories]].

=== Postmortem interface emulation ===

A concept describing potential reproduction of interfaces familiar to a personality during life within the nectosphere.

Theoretical aspects are presented in [[Techno-theories]].

=== AI assistant ===

In theoretical models, it is considered:

* during life — as an auxiliary interface;
* in post-mortem scenarios — as a potential core of a digital profile.

Within the messenger, an in-system support assistant [[Niro]] is implemented, instantiated after [[Incident NERO-01]]. Niro operates at the interface level: it supports work with artifacts and helps structure messages and the course of a session; at the same time, it is not a contact endpoint and does not possess observation on the “contact side”.

== Side effects ==

=== For the living ===

* obsessive interpretation analysis;
* illusion of control over postmortem communication;
* risk of psychological dependency with prolonged use.

=== For nodes ===

* recurring memory flashes;
* activity fragmentation with frequent contact;
* possible drift toward mainlines under overload.
