== P-FIREWALL ==

=== Purpose ===

P-FIREWALL is a multi-layered protective perimeter designed to filter and attenuate traffic between the nexthosphere and technonetworks.

It was [[Incident P-01|introduced after P-01]] and aims to reduce the risks of uncontrolled penetration of nexthospheric patterns into digital environments.

=== Functions ===

P-FIREWALL performs the following tasks:

* filtering traffic between the nexthosphere and network infrastructures;
* automatic detection and attenuation of channels corresponding to stable metaphysical patterns;
* degradation or blurring of hazardous interaction forms.

Patterns associated with any intense or repetitive emotional states may be subject to filtering if they form a stable resonance channel.

=== Architectural principles ===

From a technical perspective, P-FIREWALL relies on generalized network security practices:

* classical packet and stateful filters;
* application gateways and DPI;
* mass filtering and traffic segmentation infrastructures.

Additionally, a nexthospheric analysis layer is introduced, taking into account:

* not only packet headers and payloads, but also accompanying stable patterns;
* metadata, behavioral characteristics, and indirect channel indicators;
* rules for blocking, limiting, or distorting potentially dangerous resources.

=== Outcome ===

Deployment of P-FIREWALL has significantly reduced the likelihood of mass breaches through generalized digital resources and platforms, without eliminating the risk entirely.

A portion of traffic is displaced into marginal, experimental, or poorly controlled zones where P-FIREWALL effectiveness is limited.
