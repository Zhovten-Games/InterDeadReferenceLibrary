[^clean]

A global metaphysical “firewall” [[Incident P-01|introduced after P-01]].

Functions:

* filtering traffic between the nectosphere and technonetworks;
* automatic dropping of content that matches patterns of:
**   “lonely figures in empty rooms”;
**   stable scenarios of looping despair;
**   certain types of direct visual channels.

Architecturally, P-FIREWALL relies on existing network practices:

* classical packet and stateful firewalls;
* application gateways and DPI (deep packet inspection);
* groundwork of large national filtering infrastructures (up to analogies with the so-called “Great Chinese Firewall”).

P-FIREWALL adds an additional <u>“nectospheric layer”</u> to the TCP/IP stack and encryption protocols (SSL/TLS and their early/parallel analogues):

* not only headers and packet contents are analysed, but also stable metaphysical patterns accompanying the traffic;
* integrations are used at the level of SSL termination, MITM proxies and inspection of encrypted sessions (for example, by SNI, behavioural characteristics, metadata);
* on top of this, rules are imposed for blocking or blurring potentially dangerous channels through which nectospheric traffic may break through.

Result: mass breakthroughs at the level of “scary websites” are made much more difficult, but not completely forbidden; part of the traffic goes into underground/experimental zones where P-FIREWALL does not work fully or is bypassed.
