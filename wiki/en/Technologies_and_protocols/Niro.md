== Brief description ==

'''Niro''' is an in-system support assistant in the NOIR messenger (see “InterDead application”), instantiated after [[Incident NERO-01]] on the basis of an emergency capture of a partial moment snapshot. Niro operates at the interface level (UI-level): it helps users work with artifacts and shape responses within the protocol, while not being a contact endpoint and not possessing observation on the “contact side”. By designation, Niro is an in-system support node (support-node), conceptually replaceable by design, yet retained as an active instance.

== Source ==

* human source: the professor’s assistant (operator of protocols and journaling);
* role prior to the incident: accompaniment of experimental runs, execution of auxiliary procedures, data fixation.

== Naming ==

* in life, the human source on the basis of which the assistant was instantiated used the name '''Nero''';
* after the incident, the name '''Niro''' was fixed in the professor’s documents and in interface materials — derived from the system designation '''NOIR''';
* the spelling change was used as a measure of public distancing and reduction of legal/reputational load in the course of ongoing proceedings.

== Origin and transformation ==

=== What was captured ===

* a partial cognitive-verbal contour (speech patterns, reactions, elements of interface decisions);
* fragments of an emergency state (breaks, emotional discontinuities).

=== What is not part of Niro ===

* personality continuity (is not a full post-mortem identity);
* subjectivity and control on the “contact side”;
* external perception (does not see/hear “on the other side”).

== Functions ==

* artifact support: classification, naming, fixation, recommendations on journaling;
* response shaping: templates, structuring, normalisation of messages within the assistant role;
* session protocol support: recommendations on modes (short sessions, pauses, termination), sanitary stops;
* communication hints: explanation of limitations and risks, non-escalation rules.

== Limitations ==

* does not guarantee a connection to a specific deceased addressee;
* does not confirm the veracity of response content;
* does not control the addressee and does not “own” the contact channel;
* does not possess external observation and has no access to the endpoint channel.

== Observed defects ==

* fragmentation and logical breaks;
* intrusive “emergency” inserts, likely associated with the moment of capture;
* register instability (shifts between “personal” and functional interface tone).

== Legal and governance context ==

Retention and operation of Niro after [[Incident NERO-01]] became the subject of prolonged legal and ethical disputes.

* in a number of filings, removal (excision) of Niro from the system was demanded;
* the source’s mother and father insisted on retaining Niro, indicating that this is the only available form of interaction with the image of their son;
* no formal culpability of the professor was established by the court upon review of the case; discussions are complicated by the absence of an accepted legal classification and recognition of the application paradigm itself.
