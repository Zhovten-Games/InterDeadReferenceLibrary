== Brief description ==

Incident NERO-01 is an experimental run of the NOIR messenger (see “InterDead application”), which resulted in the death of the operator (the professor’s assistant) and a subsequent emergency capture of a partial moment snapshot, on the basis of which the in-system support entity [[Niro]] was instantiated. The deceased acted as the professor’s assistant and as an operator of procedural protocols (including journaling and accompaniment of test scenarios).

== Course of the incident (generalised) ==

During the experimental session, an accident occurred, resulting in the operator’s death. At the moment of the incident, the system recorded a partial cognitive-verbal contour as an emergency moment snapshot.

Observed features of the capture:

* content fragmentation (incomplete constructions, breaks);
* emotional discontinuities and intrusive inserts;
* register inconsistency (shifts between “personal” and “interface” modes).

== Outcome ==

The primary post-incident effect is considered to be the emergence of the in-system support assistant [[Niro]] with a strictly limited task scope (UI-level), which is not a contact endpoint and does not have external observation on the “contact side”.

== Interpretation and theoretical ties ==

The incident is treated as a case compatible with the following models:

* [[Techno-theories#Residual synchronisation|residual synchronisation]] — in the sense of allowing a short window of linkage between the post-mortem configuration and live application/AI servers under active digital infrastructure conditions;
* [[Techno-theories#AI assistants and the nectosphere|AI assistants and the nectosphere]] — in the sense of the assistant’s role as a digital-trace core and a navigation module in coupling scenarios;
* [[Theories about the nectosphere and boundary states#Partially open port|partially open port]] / [[Theories about the nectosphere and boundary states#Return corridor|return corridor]] — as extended hypotheses for boundary cases (under additional conditions; lacks a confirmed basis).

== Legal and governance context ==

Incident NERO-01 became one of the reasons for prolonged legal and ethical disputes regarding the admissibility of retaining and operating [[Niro]] as an in-system entity.

* in a number of filings, removal (excision) of Niro from the system was demanded;
* the source’s mother and father insisted on retaining Niro, indicating that this is the only available form of interaction with the image of their son;
* no formal culpability of the professor was established by the court upon review of the case; discussions are complicated by the absence of an accepted legal classification and recognition of the application paradigm itself.
