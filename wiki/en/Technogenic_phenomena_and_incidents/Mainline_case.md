[^clean]

A historical British case where:

* a physical house turned out to be at an [[Mainline intersection|intersection of nectosphere mainlines]];
* a living medium was used by the dead as a carrier of stories (the body turned into a “book” covered with texts/names).

It is considered an early documented example of a <u>local stable window</u> between the [[nectosphere]] and the world of the living.
