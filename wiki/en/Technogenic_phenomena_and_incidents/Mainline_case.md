== Overview ==

Under the name “Mainline Case,” early materials grouped together a set of heterogeneous testimonies related to so-called *bad places* — zones where intersections of nexthosphere mainlines manifest in a distorted and unstable form.

Contemporary analysis shows that such cases do not represent a singular or unique phenomenon. On the contrary, dozens of reports of a similar type have been recorded, most of which were later classified as:

* fabrications;
* erroneous interpretations of everyday or psychosocial phenomena;
* the result of secondary mythologization.

=== Verified confirmed cases ===

A small number of cases classified as conditionally confirmed demonstrate a common pattern:

* they are maximally isolated from society;
* no public documentation or media coverage exists;
* contact, if it occurs, is maintained within a narrow and closed circuit.

It is assumed that such isolation is determined not only by external pressure or institutional measures, but also by fear of losing the contact itself: continued interaction appears possible only when the observer is excluded as a social factor.

== Status ==

In the current revision, the “Mainline Case” is treated not as a specific historical incident, but as a generalized analytical label used to describe a class of adverse locations and the distortions associated with them.
