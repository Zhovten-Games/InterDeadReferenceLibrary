[^clean]

The point of junction between a living organism and the [[nectosphere]].

In the basic model:

* is activated at the moment of death (a one-time transition);
* after the state stabilises (life or death), the port is considered closed.

Extended models that allow for a partially open port and its use in complex communication protocols are set out in the section [[Theories about the nectosphere and boundary states]].
