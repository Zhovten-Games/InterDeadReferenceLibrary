[^clean]

A Japanese experiment of the early 2000s in which:

* a new communication network, in terms of its structure, <u>coincided with the topology</u> of [[Nectosphere|the nectosphere]];
* [[nectospheric traffic]] began to pass through the internet as through its own infrastructure;
* mass cases of infection with despair, disappearances of people, and demographic collapse of individual regions were recorded.

Formally, the incident is considered localised, but its consequences became the basis for the introduction of [[P-FIREWALL]].
