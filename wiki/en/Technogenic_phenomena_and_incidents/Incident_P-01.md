== Brief description ==

Incident P-01 refers to an early technogenic experiment of the early 2000s, during which a partial topological correlation was recorded between an experimental communication network and the structures of the [[Nectosphere]].

=== Course of the incident ===

During the operation of the network, the following phenomena were observed:

* passage of [[nectospheric traffic]] through digital infrastructure;
* local disruptions of communication circuit stability;
* short-term effects of disorientation and rupture of social connections.

Early reports indicated severe social consequences; however, subsequent data review demonstrated that:

* the scale of impact was limited and local;
* most effects were temporary;
* the spread was promptly identified and suppressed.

=== Consequences ===

The incident is officially considered localized, but it:

* demonstrated the fundamental possibility of coupling network technologies with nectospheric structures;
* served as the basis for the development and implementation of second-level protective protocols, later formalized as [[P-FIREWALL]].
