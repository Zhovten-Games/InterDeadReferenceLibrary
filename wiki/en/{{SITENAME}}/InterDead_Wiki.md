InterDead is a psychologically oriented horror game in development by [https://www.linkedin.com/company/zhovten-games/ Zhovten Games], with a visual novel interface and planned tabletop RPG sessions, forming the core of the eponymous [[InterDead Universe|meta-universe]].

=== Natural phenomena and structures ===
[[:Category:Natural phenomena and structures|'''Category: Natural phenomena and structures''']]

* [[Nectosphere]] – post-mortem distributed network of consciousnesses.
* [[Information_trace]] – minimal unit of a personality in the nectosphere.
* [[Nectosphere_node]] – an individual information trace treated as a node.
* [[Associative_link]] – connections between nodes and memories.
* [[Mainline]] – high-load “trunk routes” within the nectosphere.
* [[Mainline_intersection]] – crossing points of mainlines and source of “cursed places”.
* [[Local_segment]] – a bounded area of the nectosphere (by geography/event/theme).
* [[Nectospheric_traffic]] – movement of emotions, scenarios and impulses.
* [[Node_brightness]] – how visible a node is to nectospheric processes.

=== Technogenic phenomena and incidents ===
[[:Category:Technogenic phenomena and incidents|'''Category: Technogenic phenomena and incidents''']]

* [[Mainline_case]] – under the name “Mainline Case,” early materials grouped together a set of heterogeneous testimonies related to so-called bad places — zones where intersections of nectosphere mainlines manifest in a distorted and unstable form.
* [[Incident_P-01]] – refers to an early technogenic experiment of the early 2000s, during which a partial topological correlation was recorded between an experimental communication network and the structures of the Nectosphere.
* [[Incident NERO-01]] – emergency capture of a moment snapshot and instantiation of the in-system assistant Niro.
* [[Port]] – border point between a living body and the nectosphere.
* [[Return_corridor]] – hypothetical channel between a nectosphere node and a port.

=== Technologies and protocols ===
[[:Category:Technologies and protocols|'''Category: Technologies and protocols''']]

* [[P-FIREWALL]] – is an global metaphysical firewall built on top of classic network stacks.
* [[InterDead_application]] – is an experimental client for contact with the dead (emoji protocol, stealth / exposure). In the professor’s documents and in some internal materials, the application is referred to as '''NOIR''' (Nectosphere-Oriented Interface Relay) — this is the working name of the messenger/system.
** [[Emoji_Protocol]] – is an executable dialogue protocol: a message defines the contract (what is admissible as a response), and the continuation of the conversation is determined by response validity and confirmation via an ACK reaction.
** [[Niro]] – is an in-system support assistant in the messenger, instantiated after Incident NERO-01 on the basis of an emergency capture of a partial moment snapshot.
<code>'''Tip:'''  For technical deep dives into how the application works, see: [[InterDead application#InterDead application documentation (short technical specification)|'''InterDead application documentation (short technical specification)''']].</code>

=== Theories and models ===
[[:Category:Theories and models|'''Category: Theories and models''']]

* [[Theories_about_the_nectosphere_and_boundary_states]] – models of ports, brightness control, and return corridors.
* [[Techno-theories]] – residual synchronisation, post-mortem interface emulation, AI assistants and other extended models.
