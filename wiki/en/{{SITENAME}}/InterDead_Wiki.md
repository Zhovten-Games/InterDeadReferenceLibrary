[[:Category:Natural phenomena and structures|'''Category: Natural phenomena and structures''']]

* [[Nectosphere]] – post-mortem distributed network of consciousnesses.
* [[Information_trace]] – minimal unit of a personality in the nectosphere.
* [[Nectosphere_node]] – an individual information trace treated as a node.
* [[Associative_link]] – connections between nodes and memories.
* [[Mainline]] – high-load “trunk routes” within the nectosphere.
* [[Mainline_intersection]] – crossing points of mainlines and source of “cursed places”.
* [[Local_segment]] – a bounded area of the nectosphere (by geography/event/theme).
* [[Nectospheric_traffic]] – movement of emotions, scenarios and impulses.
* [[Node_brightness]] – how visible a node is to nectospheric processes.

=== Technogenic phenomena and incidents ===

* [[Mainline_case]] – historical British case of a house on a mainline intersection.
* [[Incident_P-01]] – Japanese “impulse breakthrough” and near-global collapse.
* [[Port]] – border point between a living body and the nectosphere.
* [[Return_corridor]] – hypothetical channel between a nectosphere node and a port.

=== Technologies and protocols ===
[[:Category:Technologies and protocols|'''Category: Technologies and protocols''']]

* [[P-FIREWALL]] – global metaphysical firewall built on top of classic network stacks.
* [[InterDead_application]] – experimental client for contacting the dead (emoji protocol, stealth / exposure).
** [[Emoji_Protocol]] – is an executable dialogue protocol: a message defines a contract (what is admissible as a response), and continuation of the conversation is determined by validity of the response and confirmation via an ACK reaction.
<code>'''Tip:'''  For technical deep dives into how the application works, see: [[InterDead application#InterDead application documentation (short technical specification)|'''InterDead application documentation (short technical specification)''']].</code>

* [[Theories_about_the_nectosphere_and_boundary_states]] – models of ports, brightness control, and return corridors.
* [[Techno-theories]] – residual synchronisation, post-mortem interface emulation, AI assistants and other extended models.
