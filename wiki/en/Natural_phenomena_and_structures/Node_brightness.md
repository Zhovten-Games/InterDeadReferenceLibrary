[^clean]

A measure of how noticeable a node is for [[Nectosphere|nectospheric]] processes.

==== Possible states: ====

* low brightness — the node is dissolved in the background, barely stands out;
* normal brightness — a normal node, participates in traffic;
* abnormally high brightness — a highlighted “beacon” to which other nodes strive (like to a rare resource or exit).

Questions of artificial control of node brightness and the associated risks are considered in a separate section [[Theories about the nectosphere and boundary states]].
