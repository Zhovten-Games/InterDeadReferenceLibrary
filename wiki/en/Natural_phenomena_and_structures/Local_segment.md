[^clean]

A separate portion of the [[nectosphere]], distinguished by:

* geography (city, region);
* event (war, catastrophe);
* topic (general type of death/experience).

For the perceiving subject, a local segment can manifest as a more or less coherent “environment” within which wandering or looping of scenarios occurs.
