[^clean]

Any “movement” inside the [[nectosphere]]:

* spread of emotions (despair, guilt);
* launching of recurring scenarios;
* obsessive thoughts and flashes of memories.

By analogy with network traffic:

* goes along associative links;
* concentrates on mainlines;
* can “jump” into technonetworks when the topologies coincide.
