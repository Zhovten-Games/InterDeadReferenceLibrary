# A short essay: how the 1666 idea “works”

## 1) What Leibniz is trying to do
*De arte combinatoria* is an attempt to turn thinking into an engineering discipline. Traditional logic can **check** inferences, but it is harder to **systematically discover** new ones. Leibniz sets a stricter goal: to build a form of notation for concepts such that reasoning begins to resemble calculation.

Two pillars follow from this:

- **An alphabet of simple notions** (*alphabetum cogitationum humanarum*, *termini primi*, *notiones simplices*). The point: if all complex ideas can be expressed through a finite set of simple ones, then knowledge may be formalizable.
- **Combinatorics as the engine** (*ars combinatoria*, *combinatio*). The point: new complex constructions can be generated by systematically combining elements.

## 2) Why there are two dimensions: “what you took” and “how you arranged it”
Leibniz distinguishes (at least at the level of the idea) two sources of difference:

- **Composition**: which elements are included (*complexio*). This is close to the modern notion of “choosing a subset”.
- **Order/arrangement**: how elements are placed (*situs*, *transpositio*, *ordo*, *dispositio*). This is close to “permutation”.

This is an important architectural decision. It says that meaning is produced not only by *what* is present, but also by *how* it is structured.

## 3) How this differs from “just mathematics”
Leibniz is not proposing to reduce the world to numbers. He is proposing to reduce **operations on concepts** to operations on signs (*characteres*, *signa*).

Hence the pairing:

- **characteristica universalis** — the plan for a universal symbolic notation;
- **calculus ratiocinator** — the plan for a mechanism that can perform inference on that notation.

The ideal end state (captured by *calculemus!*) is that a dispute stops being rhetorical: the parties present their notations, run the procedure, and obtain a result.

## 4) Why these are called “seeds”, not a finished system
The 1666 treatise is early. It sets out the idea, the project vocabulary, and the direction, but it does not complete the programme. That is why the formula **Logicae inventionis semina** appears: Leibniz did not “close” a universal language and a reasoning calculus, but he did provide an architectural sketch.

## 5) What has been realized and what has not (today)

It is important to distinguish Leibniz’s **programme** from how it actually materialized in science and engineering.

### Realized (in the substance of the idea)

1) **Logic as a calculus**: in modern formal logic (and its mathematical formalisms), reasoning is indeed represented as operations on formulas. This directly continues the “language + transformation rules” line.

2) **Mechanical checking of correctness**: automated and interactive theorem proving (proof assistants), formal verification of programs/protocols, and SAT/SMT solvers are practical realizations of the principle “a dispute is settled by procedure/verification”, not rhetoric.

3) **Formal specification languages**: in engineering domains, languages exist where meaning is fixed by strict syntax/semantics (even if domain-limited), matching the idea of sign-based notation (*characteres/signa*) and procedural inference.

4) **Knowledge representation and ontologies (partially)**: there are formal ontologies and domain description languages. This is close to the dream of a “universal characteristic”, but it usually works within specific fields.

### Not realized (in the original ambition)

1) **A single universal characteristic for all knowledge**: no “one common language of concepts” emerged that is equally suitable for all sciences, cultural meanings, and human experience.

2) **A single “alphabet of thought”**: the project of a finite set of universal primitives (*alphabetum cogitationum humanarum*) runs into the fact that different disciplines and practices carve the world into “simples” differently.

3) **Full automation of discovery**: the “art of invention” (*ars inveniendi*) is only partially realized; in practice, discovery (especially in rich theories) remains a mix of formal methods, heuristics, interaction, and human choice of goals.

4) **Universal solvability of disputes by calculation**: even with a formal language, many proof systems are computationally expensive or have principled limitations; therefore “calculemus” in the general case is an ideal, not a universally feasible procedure.

### Short conclusion

Leibniz **anticipated the architecture of the future**: “sign-based notation + a calculus of operations” became real in logic and computation. But his maximal dream — **a single universal language of meanings and a universal machine for resolving any dispute** — has not been realized and likely runs into semantics, the choice of primitives, and computational limits.

## 6) Practical takeaway (outside any projects)

If you translate the 1666 idea into a modern engineering mindset, it becomes five theses:

1. Reduce the domain to **primitives** (atoms).
2. Define **composition operations** (how atoms are assembled).
3. Separate “composition” and “order” as distinct sources of meaning.
4. Make knowledge **sign-based** (precise notation).
5. Aim for a procedure where “truth” is produced as the result of an operation, not as interpersonal agreement.

## Note on further expansion
If you need “as far as possible” *strictly for 1666* (mode A: only what occurs in the treatise), the next step is to go through the PDF (see “Original” in the sources below) and compile a lexicon **by chapters** with page/paragraph references. That would yield several hundred items, but it would be a dictionary-apparatus rather than an overview.
