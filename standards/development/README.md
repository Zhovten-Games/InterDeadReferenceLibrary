# Development Standards (Canonical)

This directory defines the canonical engineering standards for the InterDead project ecosystem.

## Scope

These standards apply to any repository that contains software, build tooling, or operational automation. Individual repositories may add repo-specific notes, but must not redefine the canonical rules.

## How to use

- Repository READMEs should include only a short excerpt (5–10 lines) and link here.
- Detailed engineering rules live in the files below.

- [Methodologies](./methodologies.md)
- [Testing](./testing.md)
